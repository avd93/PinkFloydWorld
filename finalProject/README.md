###About Program 3

Program 3 is based on the music video, The Wall, created by Pink Floyd. At the
beginning of the program run, the user starts in a classroom. The desk objects
are textured cube transforms, based on the desks in the video. The white walls
are also based on the video, and the chalkboard depicts a rendition of the dvd cover.

After emerging from the classroom, the user sees the walking capitalist hammers, with
the same color pattern as the marching hammers from the video. There are also a few 
hammering hammers on either edge of the concrete floor. Behind these rotating and
walking hammers, is a central wall with The Wall album cover as a texture.

The rest of the world is populated with a few random, rotating objects and textured wall.
These were taken from program 2 and were intended to loosely resemble spinning gear cogs
of a machine, in keeping with the theme. 

Finally, a meat grinder object has been hidden behind the back wall of the world.

###An important note about running Program3

Qt does not find image files on my system without the entire path, so the image path will
be wrong on a new system.

A less important note:
I added a few objects after taking some of the screen shots submitted.
